    \Large\textbf{Dear Citizens of Oklahoma and the United States,}
\end{center}

\vspace{1em}

In these pivotal times, we stand at the crossroads of progress and reflection. This open letter extends a heartfelt invitation to all Americans—regardless of political affiliation—to join in envisioning a brighter future through a shared commitment to innovation, unity, and renewal.

At the heart of this message lies the concept of the \textbf{Age of Creation}, a transformative movement designed to empower individuals, strengthen communities, and address the pressing challenges of our era. It is an opportunity to embrace the \textbf{Era of Reevaluation}, where we collectively reflect on our nation’s core values and explore innovative paths to ensure prosperity within the enduring framework of our constitutional republic.

To this end, I, Pedro Dominguez, humbly propose the idea of a provisional constitution for a visionary initiative: the \textbf{Digital States of America}. This conceptual framework seeks to honor the timeless principles of our founding documents while adapting to the demands of the digital age.

The \textbf{Digital States of America} would champion data privacy, advocate for decentralized governance, and pave the way for advancements in \textbf{artificial intelligence} and financial technologies like the cryptocurrency \textbf{Monero}. Monero, offering unparalleled privacy and security, represents a critical step toward fostering trust and autonomy for citizens navigating a rapidly evolving technological landscape.

This vision is not just about technology; it is about reimagining collaboration and citizenship. Realizing the \textbf{Digital States of America} will require immense cooperation, ingenuity, and the shared efforts of a united nation. Together, we can redefine what it means to thrive in a modern, interconnected world, ensuring that our nation remains a beacon of liberty, innovation, and opportunity for generations to come.

Let us rise to this moment as one people, united by our differences and inspired by the boundless potential of what we can achieve together.

With hope and determination,
