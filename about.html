		    <p>Welcome to the Age of Creation! My name is Pedro M. Dominguez, a 28-year-old tech enthusiast and visionary from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. I’m the innovative mind behind OKDevs.xyz, a project born from my passion for making technology accessible and inspiring for everyone. My journey in the tech world began with a simple yet strategic step: acquiring a domain from Epik Domains for just $1.99. This early decision, even now as the price stands at $12.99, underscores my belief in the foundational value of a domain for establishing an online presence.

As a novice in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’m at the beginning of what promises to be a thrilling adventure into web development. While I'm still learning the ropes, my enthusiasm for technology drives me to grasp these concepts deeply. My setup—a custom Linux Debian Operating System running on a Raspberry Pi Model 3B—embodies my commitment to lean and efficient computing. It features a dynamic window manager (dwm) that I’ve personally compiled, along with minimalist software like the Zathura PDF reader, illustrating my journey towards mastering technology piece by piece.

At the heart of okdevs.xyz lies not just a website, but a beacon for learning, sharing, and demystifying the tech world. Powered by a reliable Nginx server on AWS EC2 Debian OS, it's a platform that reflects my journey from understanding basic concepts to applying them in real-world scenarios. Through this site, I’ve also ventured into using LaTeX for crafting PDF open letters, blending technical learning with creative expression.

Now, as I stand on the cusp of a new chapter—pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science—I extend an invitation for support, collaboration, and shared growth. OKDevs.xyz isn’t merely a showcase of what I’ve learned; it’s a call to join me on a journey of discovery, innovation, and community building in the tech world. Let’s embark on this exciting adventure together, exploring and shaping the future of technology with every step.
